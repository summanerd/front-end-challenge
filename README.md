# THINX Front-End Engineer Challenge Instructions

---

##### General:
1. Use vanilla JS, jQuery, React or Vue for interactions.
2. Use plain CSS or SCSS. Do not use any libraries or frameworks.
3. Make sure your code is clean and well documented.
4. Make sure you have cross-browser checked your work (Last 2 versions of Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge).
5. Code with proper semantic markup, accessibility and performance in mind.
6. Use git often. Make sure commits are clear and specific.

The top, middle section should appear/work the same as ssense.com products when you scroll up and down the page on desktop. The zoom feature should also work and trigger whatever image you click on.

##### All text is static, except two things on the top right section:
* Black/beige should be clickable and the checkmark should appear/disappear like real world use. On page load, Black should be checked.
* Quantity +/- should be functional.
* Size dropdown should work as well with sizes XS-XXL. **Create the size dropdown without using the `select` element.**

##### For mobile responsiveness, check the design and create the breakpoint where you feel are appropriate.
